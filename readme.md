# CodeName (oYo) : An Html5 Raven Web Studio

This project is an HTML5 'site' which allows a person to connect to a [Raven Database](http://ravendb.net/).
It's an option for those people who don't really want to use the SilverLight Raven Db Studio Manager that comes provided with a stock standard Raven Db installation.

NOTE: Currently, only the list of Indexes has started to be implimented.

## DISCLAIMER
This is really important. This is really a Work In Progress. Hardly anything has been done right now, but it's just a kick start to getting to the final goal. Please help by Forking and sending in Pull Requests.


## Quick start
